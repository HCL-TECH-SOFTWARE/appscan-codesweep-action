# HCL AppScan CodeSweep Github Action
Stop insecure code from ever reaching your repository with the HCL AppScan CodeSweeep Github Action. When added to a new or existing Github Workflow, this action runs a security scan against all modified and added lines of code. Vulnerable lines of code are annotated with information to help the developer resolve the problem. Invoke the action on pull requests so both the developer and the reviewer are made aware of the problem before the code is ever merged to the repository.
